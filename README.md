Final Project

This is a headache tracker for my 9-year-old daughter.  She has frequent headaches and her pediatrician would like to know if factors like riding in the car or spending time in front of a screen are contributing. Because she splits her time between her dad's house and my house, we need a shared place to store her data, so this program writes to a Google worksheet.  It will be helpful to graph her data as well to look for patterns.  Since Autumn is 9, the buttons and drop down menus help with controlling the data input and keep things simple.

Please see this Google Sheet for the output:
